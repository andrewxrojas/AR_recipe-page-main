## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This challenge has taught me how to li:marker to make specific changes to the bullet points. Also, I learned how to use media queries more effectively. I created the mobile view first. Once I stylized the recipe layout, I used media queries to resize the layout and design to reflect the desktop view.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS styles, media query, and responsive layouts as I feel that these are important skills to learn in order to make a user friendly designs.
